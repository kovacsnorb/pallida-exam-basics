# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Functions have independent existence. They can be defined outside of a class.
Functions are defined in structured languages.
Functions are called independently.
Functions are self describing unit of code.

Methods do not have independent existence, they are always defined in a class.
Methods are defined in object oriented languages like C#.
Methods are called using instance or object.
Methods are used to manipulate instance variable of a class.

In C# there is no difference between a function and a method.

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Whenever a class or a struct is created, its constructor is called. A class or a struct may have multiple constructors that take different arguments. We can set default values with it, for example.
